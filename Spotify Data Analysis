--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into. Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. All using SQLiteStudio.

--Create table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

--Then I inserted the .csv into the table.

--Then I did some exploratory data analysis

--Top 5 artists who came out with the most songs?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) as no_songs
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) DESC
LIMIT 5

--What was the most popular song and who was the artist?
SELECT track_name, artist_name 
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity
LIMIT 1

--What was the average energy level for the top 5 most popular songs?
SELECT avg(energy)
FROM (SELECT energy 
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5)
